//! The broker: one app's scoped assistant service over UI Protocol frames.
//!
//! One [`Broker`] serves one app (one module instance). It holds its own
//! connection to the kernel (through a [`Connector`]), and:
//!
//! - binds the app's peer: `peer/prepare` with the app/account memory
//!   namespace and `resume: true`, owned by the configured originator (the
//!   host's system agent session, or a standalone app's own root session);
//!   the kernel provisions the peer's workspace. A kernel without the
//!   host-owned app peer contract (octos UPCR-2026-034) is refused, never
//!   substituted by an ordinary privileged session;
//! - opens one kernel request context per client instance
//!   (`peer/context/open`), and closes it (`peer/context/close`) when the
//!   instance closes, the account changes or the app releases;
//! - hands out handles on the app's conversation
//!   ([`OctosAppService::open_conversation`], ADR 0004 §6, 2026-09-29): the
//!   person's lane, a request context opened with `share_history` (octos
//!   UPCR-2026-034, "Parallel person context with shared history"), which
//!   runs IN PARALLEL with the peer's own session (the system agent's
//!   lane). Each handle gets a new context id. A person's message runs in
//!   its context, started on this link (the one that registered the peer's
//!   tools) with `origin` (`person`, or `app` when the app started the
//!   run), waiting only for its own context's previous turn; the kernel
//!   shows each lane's turns the other's recent rows read-only. The
//!   follower hears both lanes (its context's events and the peer
//!   session's), each event with its `lane` and speaker; history is both
//!   transcripts merged by time;
//! - keeps ONE queue per peer for the system agent's `peer/input`s on the
//!   peer's session, one turn at a time (the kernel admits one per session
//!   and queues none; `turn_in_progress` is retried), bounded: a full queue
//!   refuses an input `busy`;
//! - checks the lease on every call — context open, same account and account
//!   generation, app not released, service in the app's grant AND the
//!   instance's — before the request and again before any reply is
//!   delivered, so a late reply never reaches a new account or instance;
//! - routes each notification to the context whose session it names;
//! - is the peer's **tool host** (octos UPCR-2026-035): right after every
//!   `peer/prepare` (and so after every reconnect, which prepares again) it
//!   registers the app's tools on its own link, the one that drives the
//!   peer's turns (`peer/tools/register`, with the host's exact
//!   `generic_tools` for the app's agent when it sets them). A peer whose registration fails runs no
//!   turn. It takes every `peer/tool/call` on that link, stamps the account,
//!   the calling context's client and the caller, executes each occurrence
//!   at most once, refuses calls of turns it interrupted, and hands the call
//!   to the host ([`crate::host_tools::ToolHost`]); `peer/tool/cancel` and a
//!   closed link end calls before they run. When the app's last instance
//!   releases (the app closed, or the person turned its agent off) it
//!   releases the peer's route (`peer/tools/unregister`, octos#2658): the
//!   shell's consumers share one kernel connection that never closes, so
//!   without it the kernel would still accept the system agent's input for
//!   a peer nobody runs; now `peer_send_input` fails visibly. `peer/input` (the system agent's
//!   input) starts the peer's turn on the same link with the kernel's turn
//!   id, once per input, queued while the peer is busy; every approval
//!   (a `host_tool` one and octos's own tools', a `peer/input` turn's
//!   included) goes to the host, never to the app, and is withdrawn there
//!   when its turn ends, or its link closes, before an answer;
//! - routes the agent's questions (`user_question/requested`, octos's
//!   `ask_user_question`) on the peer's session and its contexts to the
//!   host with the turn's origin (a context's, the peer's own, or a
//!   `peer/input` turn's), answers them only as the host says
//!   (`user_question/respond` on this link), tells the app's context only
//!   that the host took it, closes them when their turn ends, and refuses
//!   an app's attempt to answer an approval or question the host holds;
//! - gives every approval and question on the peer's session and its
//!   contexts a deadline ([`BrokerConfig::prompt_deadline`], 10 min,
//!   `OCTOSENSE_PROMPT_DEADLINE_SECS`): what the host holds its router or
//!   request model expires (denied or declined, never approved), what the
//!   app holds the broker answers so; the app hears `prompt/expired`. If
//!   the host has not answered after [`BrokerConfig::expiry_grace`] (30 s)
//!   the broker denies or declines it itself, and a turn still running then
//!   is interrupted (N1 applies) so the peer's next queued turn starts;
//! - on the person's Stop (`ContextOp::Interrupt` on a conversation,
//!   [`interrupt_where`] for the shell's own surfaces) stops BOTH lanes:
//!   the person's running turn and the system agent's (the person owns the
//!   device). A plain request context's Stop stops its own turn only.
//!   The shell's "Ask <app>" panel stops one lane at a time
//!   ([`interrupt_lane_where`]): its Stop is the person's own turn, and the
//!   system agent's turn has its own control.
//!
//! Nothing here chooses a provider, touches credentials or stops a kernel it
//! does not own.
