//! The service contract an app consumes. No runtime, no kernel, no I/O.
//!
//! The contract surfaces follow Rinx ADR 0007's provider table:
//!
//! | Surface | App | Provider / host |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | Availability and services | renders [`Availability`]; rejects unsupported calls | reports readiness and the effective [`OctosAppService::services`] |
//! | Request contexts | supplies host-authenticated account + instance ([`ContextSpec`]) | binds the peer's request context and workspace |
//! | Requests and events | enforces its own grants; routes replies to the instance | enforces the lease on every call; correlates events |
//! | Model / settings | shows [`ModelInfo`] and the [`SettingsEntry`] | selects the model, keeps provider secrets |
//! | Cancellation and release | releases on close / account change; drops stale replies | cancels scoped work without stopping unrelated work |
//! | Runtime shutdown | [`OctosAppService::shutdown`] | stops only a runtime the app owns |
