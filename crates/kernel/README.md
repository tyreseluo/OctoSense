# octosense-kernel: the shell's octos kernel

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

> **Where this fits.** One octos kernel per shell: a child process on the desktop and Android, in process on OpenHarmony, none on iOS. The shell holds the host token and is the only host connection; the system agent and every app agent are sessions in this kernel, and a Talk to Octos client gets only the system conversation with the external token. Diagrams of the processes, an app agent's two lanes and a tool call with its approval: [How it fits together](../../README.md#how-it-fits-together); the details: [docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md) and [ADR 0004](../../docs/adr/0004-native-apps-hosting-and-peers.md).

The [octos](https://github.com/octos-org/octos) agent kernel is a **shell
service**. The shell (Home in `phone/`, the desktop in `desktop/`) owns it; the
**AI providers** system app configures it through the `llm` host service;
**AppCard**, and next Rinx's native mini-app host, connect to it. This crate
is that service: one kernel per process, started on demand, shared,
restarted when the providers change.

It lives in `crates/` rather than `apps/` because it is not an app: it is
the shared runtime piece the shells, AppCard (`apps/appcard/app`) and the
`llm` service (`apps/ai-providers/host-service`, feature `octos-core`) link.

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Core dir** | octos's data dir: `<core_dir>/profiles/_main.json` is the profile the AI providers app writes. Resolved as: the shell's `Options::core_dir`, else `$OCTOS_APP_CORE_DIR`, else `<app data dir>/octos-home/.octos`: OctoSense's own octos home (the platform's app data dir on a phone, the app-private home AppCard has always used; OctoSense's state dir `~/.octosense` on a desktop), else `$HOME/octos-home/.octos` (`octosense_llm_config::profile::default_core_dir()`, for a consumer that names nothing). A desktop OctoSense used to share `$HOME/octos-home/.octos` with the person's standalone octos; on first use it now copies only the provider and model settings (`llm`, `env_vars`) from there into its own profile, and never writes, moves or deletes anything there. |
| **One kernel, lazily** | The first `connect()` starts it; later ones share it. octos holds a single-writer lock on its data dir, so a second kernel on the same dir could not run anyway. |
| **Shared by frames** | A `Connection` carries UI Protocol (JSON-RPC) frames exactly as `octos serve --stdio` speaks them. Each consumer uses its own request ids and receives the replies to its requests and the notifications of the sessions it named (a notification for a session nobody named goes to every consumer). |
| **Restart** | `restart()` stops a running kernel (a no-op when none runs). Connections then end with `CloseReason::Restarted`; a consumer connects again, which starts a fresh kernel that reads the new profile. The next kernel starts only after the old one has exited and released its data dir. |
| **Idle stop** | When the last connection is dropped the kernel stops, as AppCard's own child used to (not while Talk to Octos is on, below). |
| **Talk to Octos** | Off by default. While the person has it on, the kernel is octos's host-owned loopback server and external clients can attach to the same kernel (below). |
| **Shutdown** | `shutdown()` stops it and waits (5 s at most). |

How it starts, per platform (`src/launch.rs`):

- **Android**: `<nativeLibraryDir>/liboctos.so serve --stdio`, `HOME=<core
  dir's parent>` (the octos home), with AppCard's environment
  (`OCTOS_SKILLS_PATH`, `OCTOS_OMIT_WORKSPACE_HINT`, `RUST_LOG`, the
  `makepad.OCTOS_PROXY` proxy) and the kernel config's memory budget. The APK
  must bundle the kernel: `MAKEPAD_ANDROID_EXTRA_LIBS=liboctos.so=<octos>`
  (the shells' build scripts do it).
- **OpenHarmony**: the canonical core in-process,
  `octos_cli::embedded::serve_io(<octos home>, ..)`, on this crate's runtime
  with 8 MiB worker stacks (HAP native libraries may not exec).
- **Desktop**: `<program> serve --stdio --data-dir <core_dir>` (plus
  `--config <core_dir>/config.json` when that file exists) with
  `OCTOS_HOME=<core_dir>`; the program is the shell's `Options::program` or
  `$OCTOS_APP_CORE_BIN`. With neither there is no kernel: a developer's own
  `octos serve` is never touched.
- **iOS**: no kernel.
- **Talk to Octos on** (desktop and Android): the same command with
  `--host 127.0.0.1 --host-managed` instead of `--stdio`, and the listener
  this process keeps passed as descriptor 3 (`--listen-fd 3`, Unix).

The kernel and the frame pump run on the crate's own Tokio runtime, so a
consumer may use any runtime or none.

## Using it

A shell, once at startup, before the first consumer:

```rust
octosense_kernel::configure(
    octosense_kernel::Options::default().app_data_dir(cx.get_data_dir()),
);
// The llm service (feature `octos-core`) writes under the same core dir
// and calls octosense_kernel::restart() after every change.
octosense_llm_service::register_with(
    octosense_llm_service::Options::default().core_dir(octosense_kernel::core_dir().unwrap()),
);
```

A consumer:

```rust
let mut conn = octosense_kernel::connect()?;       // Err: no kernel here
conn.send(r#"{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"session/open","params":{"session_id":"_main:api:x","profile_id":"_main"}}"#)?;
loop {
    match conn.recv().await {
        Ok(frame) => { /* a JSON-RPC frame for this consumer */ }
        Err(octosense_kernel::CloseReason::Restarted) => { /* connect again, re-open sessions */ break }
        Err(other) => { /* the kernel stopped or could not start: tell the person */ break }
    }
}
```

AppCard's transport (`apps/appcard/app/crates/octos-app-transport`,
`kernel.rs`) is the reference consumer: on `Restarted` it fails the requests
still waiting, reconnects and opens its sessions again from their replay
cursors, so the app carries on.

**Rinx and other consumers.** A native mini-app host takes its own
connection (`connect()`), opens sessions with ids of its own (Rinx uses
`<profile>:api:rinx-mini-…`) and gets only its sessions' traffic, with no
coupling to AppCard's connection or UI queue. It must handle
`CloseReason::Restarted` by reconnecting.

Other functions: `core_dir()`, `home()`, `profile()`, `launch()` /
`is_available()` (whether and how a kernel would start), `status()`, and the
Talk to Octos controls below.

## Talk to Octos

Talk to Octos lets a web client or a terminal UI talk to this device's
assistant. It is **off by default**; the kernel is then the private stdio
child above and nothing listens. **AI providers → Talk to Octos** turns it on
(`set_external_access(true)`), which:

- restarts the kernel as `octos serve --host-managed` (octos
  [`docs/HOST_MANAGED_SERVE.md`](https://github.com/octos-org/octos/blob/main/docs/HOST_MANAGED_SERVE.md));
  native consumers keep the same frames over its WebSocket with a host token
  that never leaves this process (the kernel gets both tokens on its stdin,
  never in its environment), and request octos's stdio feature set
  (`octos_core::ui_protocol::UI_PROTOCOL_STDIO_DEFAULT_FEATURES`);
- mints an **external token**. It opens `/api/ui-protocol/ws` and nothing
  else, and there only an allowlist of session, turn, answer and read-only
  status methods: no configuration (providers, keys, skills, snapshots), no
  `server/shutdown`, nothing on an app's assistant's sessions (host-owned app
  peers), and answers only in sessions it opened. Its turns get no tool that
  runs code, administers octos or reaches peers (octos UPCR-2026-036);
- keeps the listener in this process (Unix) and hands it to every kernel
  generation, so a restart keeps the port and no other app can take it in
  between. Elsewhere a restart reuses the port when it is free, and otherwise
  moves to a new port with a new external token;
- keeps the server up when native consumers leave, until it is turned off or
  the shell exits. The kernel's stdin is its lifeline: when the shell exits or
  crashes, the kernel sees EOF and stops.

How clients get in:

- **Web.** The sheet's **Pair a web client** enables octos's pairing
  (`pairing()`): an 8-character code, valid for five minutes and one claim,
  shown with a QR of the web client's link
  (`<web origin>/?octos=<server>&pair=<code>`). The code only works while
  that sheet is open (`end_pairing()` when it closes). The web origin saved on
  the sheet is the only browser origin the server trusts: `https`, or on a
  desktop also `http` for localhost, 127.0.0.1 or [::1] (Android: https
  only). A malformed saved origin counts as none; the kernel still starts.
- **Terminal.** The connection file `connection_file(core_dir)`
  (`<core_dir>/client-connection.json`, mode 0600; on Windows
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OctoSense\client-connection.json`, whose default ACL admits
  this user, SYSTEM and administrators) holds the endpoint and the external
  token for a client of this user. It is rewritten when the port or token
  changes and removed when the server stops. Terminal UI launch is
  **unverified**.
- **Revoke all clients** (`rotate_external_access()`) mints a new external
  token and restarts the server; **Turn off** (`set_external_access(false)`)
  stops it, forgets the token and port, and removes the connection file.

A computer reaches a phone's server through a tunnel that keeps the port
number, since the server only answers requests whose `Host` names its own
port (**unverified on a device**):

```sh
adb -s SERIAL forward tcp:PORT tcp:PORT
```

The system conversation is `_main:api:octosense#system` in profile `_main`;
its workspace is saved in `system-workspace.txt` so native opens and Web's
scoped session agree. OpenHarmony (embedded core) and iOS (no kernel) have no
Talk to Octos. See [ADR 0003](../../docs/adr/0003-shared-octos-client-access.md)
for the threat model.

## The system agent's tools

[ADR 0004](../../docs/adr/0004-native-apps-hosting-and-peers.md) §12: the
system agent's tool set is its grants. Its default octos tools are
`system_tools::SYSTEM_AGENT_TOOLS`: supervision (`peer_send_input`,
`peer_gather`, `peer_list`, `peer_respond`; never `peer_close`, which the
profile's `tool_policy` denies to every agent, since octos cannot resume a
closed peer), its workspace's
file tools (octos fences them to the session's working directory), memory,
`ask_user_question`, media viewing, octos's `web_search` / `web_fetch` (until
toolbox grants replace them, #108) and `tool_search`. Granted toolbox and
cross-app tools join it as host tools through `SystemAgentTools`. Command
execution is **done** as a grant: the person's switch in Setup → Assistant →
Command execution (off by default; turning it on needs the confirmation the
person types, which says what it risks; `crates/shell/src/system_chat/grants.rs`)
gives the system agent the host tool `terminal.run` through
`SystemAgentTools::grant_command_execution`. The shell hands the grants to
this crate (`system_tools::set_grants`); each kernel start takes them
(`grants_at_start`, `system_agent_tools_in_effect()`), so a change applies
after a restart, which Settings offers. Each command goes through the shell's
approval router as `auto_approvable: false` with a live sheet showing the exact
command (developer mode still answers it). While the switch is on, the
shell's system chat registers the host tool on the system session over its own
connection (octos#2567's host session target, `peer/tools/register` without
`peer`) and withdraws it when the switch goes off; the shell types each approved
call into the Terminal the person sees.

**What the kernel enforces.** Every start writes the `_main` profile's
`tool_policy` (`system_tools::tool_policy`): everything a grant can give,
minus octos's own shell (`group:runtime`: `shell`, `bash`, `exec_command`,
`write_stdin`), the one tool OctoSense never offers, since §12 grants command
execution only as a host tool, and `peer_close`. octos applies it to every
turn of the profile, wake continuations included: the ceiling. So:

- **The system agent gets exactly its list** (§12, plan step 4): every
  kernel start sets the system session's kernel tools to
  `SystemAgentTools::kernel_tools` (octos `session/tool_list/set`,
  octos#2648) on the host's own connection, before any consumer's frame
  reaches the kernel, and `system_tools::set_grants` sets it again on a
  running kernel. octos keeps the list durably and narrows every turn on the
  session with it, whoever starts it (the shell, a Talk to Octos client, a
  wake continuation). Its host tools (command execution's `terminal.run`)
  are registered by the system chat and are not filtered by it; the `spawn`
  family is never on it (`SPAWN_FAMILY`). Real-kernel test:
  `a_system_agent_turn_is_offered_exactly_the_system_agent_tools`;
- app peers are narrowed to their grants by their turns' `generic_tools`
  (plan step 6);
- Talk to Octos external turns keep octos's own allowlist.

The policy is written only into OctoSense's own core dir, and only over a
policy OctoSense wrote (`"owner": "octosense"`): a foreign policy, or the
person's own `$HOME/octos-home/.octos`, is refused with a warning.

## Testing

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p octosense-kernel   # unit tests + the core against a stand-in kernel (python3)
# The real kernel: a profile written by octosense-llm-config, session/open,
# profile/llm/list, a provider change and a restart; Talk to Octos on and off
# (what the external token must not reach, pairing, restart and rotation);
# native and web clients on one system conversation; and a host killed with
# SIGKILL taking its kernel with it. Build octos at the rev the root
# Cargo.toml pins, then:
OCTOS_CORE_TEST_KERNEL=/path/to/octos cargo test -p octosense-kernel --test real_kernel -- --nocapture
```

Build the kernel for that test (and for an Android APK, with the NDK and
`--target aarch64-linux-android`) from octos-org/octos at the rev in the root
`Cargo.toml` `[workspace.dependencies]`:

```sh
cargo build --release -p octos-cli --bin octos --no-default-features --features api,git,ast
```

`python3 tools/kernel-artifact.py --host --plan` prints the same build of the
pinned revision for this desktop.

CI: `.github/workflows/apps.yml` (the `services` job tests this crate; the
`apps` job builds AppCard, which links it).

## One octos

This crate links `octos-core` (for the stdio feature set) and, on
OpenHarmony, `octos-cli`, from git octos-org/octos at the one rev the root
`Cargo.toml` pins for every octos crate. A workspace that builds it for
OpenHarmony also needs the `nix` patch (octos rev `18fcd3f1`, see the root
`Cargo.toml` `[patch.crates-io]`). Elsewhere the kernel is a separate binary
built from that same rev.
