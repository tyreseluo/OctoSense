//! Where the manifests and the accounts reach the host's storage (ADR 0004
//! §11). Every function here takes the [`Storage`] it acts on, so tests run
//! on scratch homes; the shell passes [`super::host`].
//!
//! - **Manifests.** A native app's `native-apps.json` `storage` block
//!   ([`register_native_specs`], at startup, before any module is created)
//!   and a script app's App Hub `manifest.json` block ([`prepare_script_app`],
//!   at install and at every launch) are parsed with [`StorageSpec`] and
//!   recorded with [`Storage::set_spec`]; [`Storage::open`] then lays out the
//!   jail, the account folders, `common/`, `cache/` and the secrets from it.
//!   A block the host refuses leaves the app on the default (one `device`
//!   folder) and is logged: a reviewed native entry is checked by
//!   `tools/native_apps.py` first, and App Hub refuses a bad script block at
//!   install.
//! - **Quotas.** A native app's jail is measured when it opens and a warning
//!   is logged over its `max_bytes` / `cache_max_bytes` ([`check_quota`]);
//!   a script app's isolate enforces its own.
//! - **Accounts.** [`account_changed`] is the broker's report of an app's
//!   bound account (Rinx's Matrix login and logout, through
//!   `OctosAppService::set_account`); [`mail_account`] is Mail's host service
//!   adding or removing an account for an app; [`app_uninstalled`] is App
//!   Hub's uninstall. They sign in (open the account's folder; the broker
//!   then resumes its peer), sign out (suspend: the broker closes the
//!   request contexts, `crate::host_tools` answers `signed_out` and starts no
//!   turn), remove an account or uninstall (delete the folders, stay
//!   suspended). The agent's transcript and memory stay in octos until it has
//!   a `peer/purge` (octos#2604): [`memory_notice`] is what Settings says.
